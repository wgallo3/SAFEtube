Sample video player for SAFE Network

Uses <a href="http://www.videojs.com" target="_blank">Video.JS</a> in a contained way so that you can host and view your own videos on the SAFE Network.

Currently limited to 25mb files. Hard MaidSafe-enforced limit, but may be lifted once vaults are ready!

ToDo:
- Learn how to upload files with safe-js and add ability for users to upload videos
- create tool that automatically generates links & display functions for each uploaded video
- FIX BUG THAT ALLOWS VIDEOS TO PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY! a result of poor site design?
- rework how display = "none" functions work, find a smarter way?

Lets get video going with SAFE!

Thanks for looking!
